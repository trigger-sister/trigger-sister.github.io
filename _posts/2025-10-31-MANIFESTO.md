# So, what are we doing here, anyways?

> The ‘'nothing’' is as this immediate, self-same, just as conversely ‘'the same’', which is ‘'being’'. The truth of both being and nothingness is therefore the “unity” of both; this unity is “becoming”.

You may be tempted to calculate the exact coordinates that lie between Art, Gender, and Raleigh Nightlife, in an attempt to understand who is writing this blog and for whom - and whether or not its for you or worth your time. Although I cannot reveal the idenities of our various contributors, I hope that I can paint a little picture for you to help you make up your own mind.

This blog is written by outcasts. Thrown out of our own heads and homes, we walk the Raleigh streets afterdark and mingle across a variety of dimensions. Some are artists of the spoken, written, painted, sketched, or musical varieties. Some are thinkers. Most are movers-and-shakers. Although most of us are queer, what we all actually have in common is that we don't fit in anywhere.

We come together because we've found an echo of ourselves in each other. We have been trekking through the Raleigh dark, stumbling through bars, nightclubs, and hearts. We've discussed philosophy and live music, sculpture and semiotics, the painful wounds of living in a cis-dominated society and how to find our way to happiness.

If you want to hear about all the little holes in the wall and their associated debauchery - arts and culture included - then you may find something fun or insightful. You might benefit from hearing about which places we patrol, what kinds of scenes they have, or which characters we meet there. 

But the real target audience isn't just anyone. If you follow the advice that everyone says to follow and find that is not enough to make you happy, then you might not be like other people. If you immerse yourself in the tidal wave of discussion groups, mutual aid centers, poetry slams, jam bands, or other affinity groups without much to show for it... you might be not like other people. If you deal with tough gender troubles and constant consternations and confusions - things that seem bizarre or incomprehensible to cis-society and queer folks alike - you might just be not like other girls (or boys, or NBs, or...)

You are the one we wrote this blog for. We hope you will find our discussion on arts, culture, and gender not just interesting but personally fruitful and fulfilling. Maybe the events we list on the calendar will pique your interest and inspire a new journey. If you have a contribution of your own then please reach out - our DMs are always open for questions, comments, or potential submissions. And we want to hear from all the other queer Raleigh-ites who prowl after dark. Even if you choose not to participate in this blog-discussion I still have hope that someday soon under the dark Raleigh sky, maybe on a patio outside our favorite dive bar, by way of fate we will finally find each other.

Regards,
